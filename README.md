ðŸ“Š Monthly Work Hours & Progress Tracker (Google Calendar + Google Sheets)

This Google Apps Script project tracks total working hours per month by reading events from your Google Calendar and logging the data into a connected Google Sheet. Itâ€™s designed to help freelancers, contractors, or part-time workers monitor their workload and stay within their target hours.

By automatically logging daily and monthly totals and enforcing a weekly hour cap, it ensures better control over time management and project pacing.

âœ… Features
Reads events from a specified Google Calendar (e.g., "CA Job").
Calculates total hours worked per month and logs it into a Google Sheet.
Optionally enforces a weekly hour cap (e.g., 30 hours/week).
Automatically updates or adds monthly data rows.
Ideal for remote workers needing transparency or time-tracking.

ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

Customize Settings

Adjust maxWeeklyHours = 30 to change the weekly cap.
You can manually add months in Column A (e.g., May 2025) for backtracking.
